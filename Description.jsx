                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Formed by a group of students with a diverse background as education,
                        marketing and even music, we had our lives changed after a really intense
                        web development bootcamp. A few months later, we just couldn't stay apart.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        We are a youth and dynamic team of curious individuals driven by a shared
                        passion for technology (and pay our bills). We are real people trying to change the future.
                        We are HappyCode!
